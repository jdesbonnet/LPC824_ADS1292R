# LPC824_ADS1292R

TI ADS1292R ECG front end IC with LPC824 microcontroller PCB. CAD software: KiCad.

Design goals:
  * Breadboard compatible breakout board format
  * Can use without LPC824 (all important pins on breakout header)
  * 3.5mm audio jack for ECG lead
  * Incorporate flash for storage
  * Coin cell
  * Option for radio (RFMxx?)
